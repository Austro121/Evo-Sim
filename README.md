Versioning

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[a|b|c][PRE-RELEASE NUMBER]

a = alpha (early development, may be unstable)

b = beta (more stable, still testing)

f = full release (production-ready)


Pre-release number:

Tracks iterations of pre-release versions for developers.

For example:

0.001.0a2 → second alpha release

0.001.0b1 → first beta release


This number does not reset when moving to a patch or minor release; it shows how many pre-release iterations existed before the current stable release.


Keep an eye on the version to track stability and new features.
